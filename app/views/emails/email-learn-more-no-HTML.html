    What you can do with your NHS login
  </h2>
  <p>At the moment you have an NHS login with a verified email address and phone number. With this, you can do simple tasks like read general medical information or book a COVID-19 test.</p>
  <p>To access all areas of other services, you may need to be matched to your NHS record. When you do this you will be able to do more things, like contact your GP.</p>
  <p>If you want to access your health records or personal information on any of the services you visit, you will need to prove who you are.</p>
