      <p>NHS Digital (“we” or “us”) uses cookies to deliver the NHS login service. The information set out in this policy is provided in addition to our <a href="privacy">privacy notice</a> and should be read alongside it.</p>
      <p>We put small files called cookies onto your device, like your mobile phone or computer. Cookies are widely used to make websites and apps work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide services and functionalities for users.</p>
      <p>The cookies we use on NHS login fall into 2 categories, strictly necessary cookies and optional cookies.</p>
      <p>We put:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>strictly necessary cookies on your device for NHS login to work</li>
        <li>optional cookies on your device to collect information about how people use NHS login and help us make improvements to it</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will ask for your explicit consent before putting optional cookies on your device. Optional cookies will only be placed on your device when you request relevant added or alternative functionality. You can stop the use of optional cookies by following the guidance in the “<a href="manage-cookies">managing optional cookies</a>” section of this policy.</p>

      <p>NHS login uses a testing tool called VWO to help improve the service and deliver the best experience. This means we also use <a href="https://help.vwo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033990873-Cookies-Stored-by-VWO" target="blank">VWO's list of strictly necessary cookies</a> to help us understand and track how you use the NHS login website.</p>
      <p>We use software called Adobe Analytics and Hotjar to collect information about how you use NHS login. For example, we collect information on the steps you make, what you select and when you leave. This helps us identify what doesn’t work so we can improve it.</p>
      <p>The only personal information processed by our analytical software is a unique visitor I.D. which is created for you each time you visit NHS login. The unique visitor I.D. is used to process events based on the ‘purpose’ of the cookie, so that we understand your interaction with the NHS login service. This unique visitor I.D. doesn’t directly identify you, but it does help us improve the service further.</p>
      <p>We do not allow Adobe Analytics or Hotjar to use or share our analytics data. Visit the Adobe or Hotjar website for more information on how they handle your data.</p>
