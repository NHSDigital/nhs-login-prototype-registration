      <p>NHS Digital (“we” or “us”) uses cookies to deliver the NHS login service. The information set out in this policy is provided in addition to our privacy notice and should be read alongside it.</p>
      <p>We put small files called cookies onto your device, like your mobile phone or computer. Cookies are widely used to make websites and apps work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide services and functionalities for users.</p>
      <p>The cookies we use on NHS login fall into 2 categories, strictly necessary cookies and analytical cookies.</p>
      <p>We will ask for your explicit consent before putting strictly necessary cookies and analytic cookies on your device. Optional cookies will only be placed on your device when you request relevant added or alternative functionality.</p>

    <div id="analytic-cookies"><h2>Analytic cookies</h2>
      <p>We put analytic cookies on your device to collect information about how people use NHS login and help us make improvements to it.</p>
      
      <p>We use software called <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/analytics/adobe-analytics.html">Adobe Analytics</a> and <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a> to collect information about how you use NHS login.</p>

      <p>For example, we collect information on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>what steps you make</li>
        <li>what you select</li>
        <li>when you leave</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This helps us identify what doesn’t work so we can improve it.</p>

      <p>The only personal information processed by our analytical software is a unique visitor I.D. which is created for you each time you visit NHS login. The unique visitor I.D. is used to process events based on the ‘purpose’ of the cookie, so that we understand your interaction with the NHS login service. This unique visitor I.D. doesn’t directly identify you, but it does help us improve the service further.</p>

      <p>We do not allow Adobe Analytics or Hotjar to use or share our analytics data. Visit the Adobe or Hotjar website for more information on how they handle your data.</p>
